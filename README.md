# Pit

This is my implementation of the Pit assignment.<br />
This is a unique and different Assignment from the usual "Create an application" assignments and I had a great time doing it.<br />
The main idea i used is to override the onDraw method and drew myself the Pit layout (Points , Edges , Axis).<br />
I took the liberty to add a frame for the Pit layout to block the movement of the points outside of the Pit layout.<br />
Full disclosure - i implemented the drag mechanism based on Android developer Drag ans Scale section (https://developer.android.com/training/gestures/scale) 
with a few minor improvements to be more suitable for my implementation.
I asked Roi who asked Tome about the lack of definition for points overlapping and didn't got a response about it until i handed the assignment so for now there is overlapping of points.
